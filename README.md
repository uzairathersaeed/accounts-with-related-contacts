## 1. Account Table:
A table is presented to display a list of accounts. Each row in the table represents a unique account and includes key details such as the account name, industry, and annual revenue.

## 2. Account Details Interaction:
On clicking any account in the table, a dynamic section adjacent to the table is updated to display related contacts for the selected account. This dynamic section is initially hidden and only appears upon a user's interaction.

## 3. Contact Table:
A secondary table is introduced to showcase related contacts for the selected account. This table provides information about each contact, including their name, email, and phone number.

## 4. Dynamic Forms:
Two dynamic forms are incorporated into the interface to allow users to insert new data seamlessly.
Insert New Account Form: Users can fill in relevant details such as the account name, industry, and annual revenue to add a new account to the list. The form is designed to dynamically submit data.
Insert New Contact Form: Users are provided with a form to insert new contacts related to the selected account. The form requests details such as the contact name, email, and phone number.

## 5. Toast Notifications:
Toast notifications are strategically implemented to convey success or error messages to the user. When a new account or contact is successfully added, a success toast is displayed. In contrast, if there is an issue with the data entered, an error toast communicates the nature of the problem.

## 6. User-Friendly Interaction:
The interface prioritizes user-friendly interactions, ensuring a smooth experience when navigating through accounts, viewing related contacts, and adding new data. Features such as dynamic forms, responsive tables, and intuitive error handling contribute to a positive user experience.

## 7. Seamless Integration with Salesforce:
Leveraging the Lightning Web Components framework, this interface seamlessly integrates with Salesforce, making it a cohesive part of the Salesforce ecosystem. This ensures that users can work with account and contact data efficiently within the Salesforce platform.
